What is this?

[1] Paragrapher.py - A very cute python script that adds a new line every 3rd sentence that is seperated by dots.

|
| Compiled using: `pyinstaller -F <path>`
|
V 

[2] Paragrapher_Compile + paragrapher.exe - The compiled exe version of the py script.

|
| Un'exe'ed using: `py pyinstxtractor.py <path>` (located in the pyinstxtractor directory)
|
V

[3] Paragraph.exe_extracted - The outcome of pyinstxtractor. Containing the compiled pyton binary (.pyc)

|
| Decompiled using pycdc (Uncompyle6): `pycdc/debug/pycdc.exe -o <output file path> <.pyc path>`
|
V

[4] Paragrapher_decompiled.py - The decompiled version of the exe, interestingly the looping mechanism was interpreted differently from what I wrote.

```diff
- so it afgain but compile the python to exe to a single file, one that can run from any folder without all the dependencies in build folder/spec file
```
