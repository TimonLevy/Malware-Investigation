What is this?<br>
<br>
[1] Paragrapher.py - A very cute python script that adds a new line every 3rd sentence that is seperated by dots.<br>
<br>

| Compiled using: `pyinstaller -F <path>`                      <br>
|                                                              <br>
V                                                              <br>
<br>
[2] Paragrapher_Compile + paragrapher.exe - The compiled exe version of the py script.<br>
<br>
|                                                              <br>
| Un'exe'ed using: `py pyinstxtractor.py <path>` (located in the pyinstxtractor directory) <br>
|                                                              <br>
V                                                              <br>
<br>
[3] Paragraph.exe_extracted - The outcome of pyinstxtractor. Containing the compiled pyton binary (.pyc)<br>
<br>
|                                                              <br>
| Decompiled using pycdc (Uncompyle6): `pycdc/debug/pycdc.exe -o <output file path> <.pyc path>`<br>
|                                                              <br>
V                                                              <br>
<br>
[4] Paragrapher_decompiled.py - The decompiled version of the exe, interestingly the looping mechanism was interpreted differently from what I wrote.<br>
<br>
```diff
- do it again but compile from python to a single exe file, one that can run from any folder without the dependencies in build folder/spec file
```
