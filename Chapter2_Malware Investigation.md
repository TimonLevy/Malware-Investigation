# MALWARE INVESTIGATION

<details>
<summary>For Daniel</summary>
This chapter describes the process of malware investigation, there are a 4 techniques you can use to investigate malware:
<br><br>

1. **Basic Static Investigation**
> Investigating the process without opening it or looking at it's code.
> <details><summary>Popular tools to use:</summary>
> - CFF Explorer                               <br>
> - Dependencies Walker                        <br>
> - Strings                                    <br>
> - PEiew                                      <br>
> - PEID                                 </details>

2. **Basic Dynamic Investigation**
> Investigating the malware while it's running in a sandbox to see what it performs and how it affects the system.
> <details><summary>Popular tools to use:</summary>
> - Wireshark                                  <br>
> - Procmon                                    <br>
> - Procexp                                    <br>
> - Regshot                                    <br>
> - INetSim                              </details>

3. **Advanced Static Investigation**
> - In this stage we wil open the malware in a disassembler, a populare choise is IDA. Then we will look at the code <br>
> and try to understand it's flow without running it.

4. **Advanced Dynamic Investigation**
> This time we will run the malware and attach a debugger to it, this way we can track the code that it's running, tell <br>
> it where to pause, look at the CPU register values and even edit them. IDA can do that as well.

## Question 1 - WHY WOULD WE RATHER PERFORM TECHNIQUES 1 & 2 FIRST OVER 3 & 4?

Steps 1 and 2 of the investigation process would be the ones we want to use first because they allow us to gether up a lot of information about the malware without much effort. The thing about steps 3 & 4 is that they require extensive knowledge about coding and how files work. In steps 1 & 2 we can discern so much information like: strings(paths, addresses, reg keys, names), imported modules, affected registry keys and a lot more that can be used to help us classify and identify the malware without using advanced investigation techniques like RE.

## Question 2 - SHOULD WE ALWAYS PERFORM TECHNIQUES 3 & 4?

Short answer, yes. I think every malware should be looked upon thoroughly. Long answer, basic malware forensics can sometimes be enough to find out what the malware is doing.
Sometimes preforming a simple thorough basic static & dynamic anlysis' can be the key to figuring out a malicious executable's actions. However, when in charge of a tactical network that is very important you can never be too sure. That's why there are malware investigation teams. THERE ARE malicious .EXEs that looking at using basic tools will tell you what they do but in order to really utillize the investigtion to the fullest it is necessary to really look into the malware.
