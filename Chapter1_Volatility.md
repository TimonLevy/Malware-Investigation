# CHAPTER 1 - VOLATILITY

This chapter is oriented around learning the memory forensics investigation tool that is Volatility. I will be using the standalone executable version 2.6.

First thing we need to learn is the syntax of the commands and the modules that the tool provides. I will write a single line summary of each modules and some bulletpoints as well:

```
syntax:

volatility.exe -f <memory_file> module_name --profile=<os_profile>
```

#### Modules
```diff
-for every module add what are the parameters it shows/uses
```

**imageinfo** -  Provides info about the operating system and the structure of the memory file.<br>

**pslist** - Provides a list of the "active" processes at the time of the dump, this will sometimes list inactive processes.<br>
```diff
- why active in ""? and why will it list inactive processes?
- what parameters does it show about each process?
```

**pstree** - Prints the output of _pslist_ in a hierarchical structure of parent and child processes.<br>

**psscan** - Prints all structures with the `Proc` kernel pool tag, allowing it to print freed (terminated) or hidden processes as well as the active ones. This searching method can be countered by deleting the tag.<br>

**dlllist** - Prints all the loaded dlls in memory, can print dlls loaded by a specific procees with the `-p`\\`--pid` argument.<br>
```diff
- name the rest of the parameters the command shows
```

**handles** - Lists all the handles being used by a process or all processes.<br>

**cmdscan/consoles** - Both modules show commands typed into cmd on the machine. However consoles has the advantage of showing the output of the commands as well as the command itself.<br>

**filescan** - This modules finds file objects in memory using pool tags.<br>

**dlldump** - Extracts dlls from the memory file to disk, this modules can dump the DLLS from specific processes. Hidden processes or even DLLs that weres automatically detected dues to malicious activity.<br>

**procdump** - This modules can dump a running process' executable file into disk. Use the `-u` flag to bypass sanity checks.<br>

**dumpfiles** - Dumps the files that were entered into the VAD (Virtual Address Descriptor) tree. Files may not be stored complete so the dumped files may be "corrupt".<br>

**dumpregistry** - Dumps the all registry hive files it can find, can also dump specific hive files with a `-o` offset argument. Hives may be dumped with some holes which could lead to the crashing of other tools.<br>

**malfind** - Finds injected DLLs\Code segments based on certein charisteristics like unrecognized executables or inconsistent VAD tags. You can export the found segments using the `-D` argument.<br>
```diff
- what exactly is it looking for to say something is suspicious?
```

**hollowfind** - This module's purpose is to find instances of process hollowing, it does this by finding inconsistencies in the VAD or PEB structures.<br>

**psxview** - This modules employs many different ways to enumerate the running processes and compares the findings in columns. This can be used to detect hidden processes that are undetected in some scans but seen in others.<br>

**netscan** - Prints a similar output to the `netstat` utility tool. Also uses a similar method to do so. This module prints network artifacts, endpoints and port statuses.<br>

**apihooks** - This module detecs IAT, EAT and other porms of api hooking using JMP and CALL commands and more.

Now here is a story all about how,<br>
Team Matrix was turned right upside down.<br>
And I'd like to tell, just sit right,<br>
Duck Momo was taken hostage by a pregnant women's heir.<br>

In Basis Gidonim, by Matrix bought,<br>
He just sat in the meamen withought any thought.<br>
Chillin out, relaxin, maxin all cool,<br>
and wearning coomta, looking like a fool.<br>

When a pergnant women came and was up to no good,<br>
Started making trouble in the neighborhood.<br>
She took her little infant and Barvazi Momo away,<br>
and we haven't seen him ever since that day.<br>
